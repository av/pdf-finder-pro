# Performance Specifications

This directory contains performance optimization plans and benchmarking documentation.

## Structure

Each performance initiative should be documented:
```
performance/
└── YYYY-MM-performance-topic/
    ├── README.md           # Performance overview
    ├── benchmarks.md       # Current benchmarks
    ├── optimization.md     # Optimization strategies
    └── results.md          # Results and metrics
```

## Performance Documentation

Include:
- Current performance metrics
- Performance goals
- Optimization strategies
- Implementation plan
- Before/after benchmarks
- Trade-offs analysis

## Examples

Future performance specs might include:
- Search query optimization
- Indexing performance improvements
- Large file handling
- Memory usage optimization
- Startup time reduction
- Result pagination strategy

See [../README.md](../README.md) for detailed guidelines.
