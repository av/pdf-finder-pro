# Marketing Plan: Closed-Source Desktop App with Free Trial

## Context

- Closed-source desktop PDF search tool  
- Price: $5-10 one-time payment
- Free trial to reduce purchase friction
- Won't go viral, not HN/GitHub material
- Need realistic paid acquisition or direct sales

---

## Free Trial Strategy

**14-day trial, no limitations**
- Full functionality during trial
- No credit card required
- Trial expires, shows purchase prompt
- Simple license key activation after purchase

Why 14 days not feature-limited:
- Easier to implement (time-based vs feature gates)
- Users actually test it properly
- Less support burden
- Industry standard for desktop tools

---

## Distribution Channels (Realistic)

### 1. Directories (Minimal Effort, Passive Income)

**Software download sites**:
- AlternativeTo.net (list as Adobe/Zotero alternative)
- SourceForge
- Softpedia
- FileHorse
- CNET Download (if they still accept submissions)

**Effort**: 3-4 hours one-time
**Expected**: 5-20 downloads/month after 6 months
**Conversion**: 5-10% = 0-2 sales/month

### 2. Niche Communities (If Active Member)

**Only if you actually participate**:
- Zotero forums (as alternative for simple use case)
- Legal tech communities (for contract search)
- Academic productivity Discord servers

**Approach**: Answer questions helpfully, mention tool when relevant
**Don't**: Spam with "check out my tool" posts

### 3. Direct Sales (High Effort, Possible)

**University libraries**:
- Contact digital resources librarians
- Pitch as tool for faculty/grad students
- Bulk license: $100 for 25 seats
- Email template + follow-up

**Law firms**:
- Contact office managers of small firms (2-10 lawyers)
- Pitch as contract search tool
- Bulk license: $50 for 10 seats
- LinkedIn outreach

**Effort**: 20-40 hours over 2 months
**Expected**: 1-5 bulk sales if you find right contacts
**Revenue**: $100-500 one-time

### 4. Paid Ads (Test with $200 Budget)

**Google Ads only**:
- Long-tail keywords: "desktop pdf search tool", "local pdf indexer"
- $5/day for 40 days
- Landing page → free trial download
- Track trial → purchase conversion

**Expected**:
- 100-200 clicks at $1-2 CPC
- 10-20 trial downloads
- 1-3 purchases at $5 = $5-15 revenue
- ROI: Negative, but validates demand

**Decision point**: After $200 spent:
- If 3+ purchases → might scale
- If 0-1 purchases → ads don't work, stop

---

## Landing Page (Already Exists)

**What to add**:
- "Download 14-Day Free Trial" CTA
- FAQ: "What happens after trial?" → "App shows purchase prompt, $X to continue"
- Testimonials section (empty for now)
- Simple email capture for trial users

**What NOT to add**:
- Blog
- Use case articles
- Comparison tables (unless you actually test competitors)
- Fake testimonials

---

## Payment Implementation Alignment

**Assuming you've planned**:
- Lemon Squeezy for payment processing
- License key generation
- Key validation in app

**Marketing needs**:
- Clear "Buy Now" link from trial expiration
- Email to trial users on day 10: "Trial ending soon"
- Simple key activation flow (paste key, activate)

---

## Realistic Outcomes

### Month 1:
- 10-30 trial downloads
- 1-3 purchases ($5-30 revenue)
- Listed on 3-5 directories
- Tested Google ads ($200 spent)

### Month 3:
- 50-100 trial downloads total
- 5-15 purchases ($50-150 revenue)
- Maybe 1 bulk sale if direct outreach worked ($50-100)
- Total: $100-250 revenue

### Month 6:
- 150-300 trials total
- 15-50 purchases ($150-500 revenue)
- Passive directory traffic starting
- Know which channel works (if any)

---

## Failure Scenarios

**Nobody downloads trial** (< 10 in month 1):
- Landing page unclear
- Problem not painful enough
- Wrong target audience
- Fix: Talk to 5 people who have PDFs, ask if they'd use it

**Trial users don't convert** (< 5% conversion):
- Product doesn't solve problem well enough
- Price too high for value
- Trial too short to build habit
- Fix: Survey non-converters, adjust based on feedback

**Can't get traffic** (< 50 visits/month):
- SEO won't work for 12+ months
- Paid ads too expensive
- No viral/word-of-mouth
- Fix: Direct sales only, or give up

---

## What NOT to Do

- Don't run Facebook/Reddit ads (wrong audience, won't convert)
- Don't cold email PhD students (they won't respond)
- Don't write blog posts (no traffic for years)
- Don't try to "go viral" (this tool won't)
- Don't build features nobody asked for
- Don't spend > $500 validating this

---

## Actual Next Steps

**Week 1**: Implement trial
- Time-based expiration (14 days from first launch)
- Purchase prompt when expired
- License key activation

**Week 2**: List on directories
- Write descriptions
- Upload screenshots
- Submit to 5 directories

**Week 3**: Test Google ads
- $5/day, long-tail keywords
- Track clicks → trials → purchases
- Run for 2 weeks minimum

**Week 4**: Evaluate
- Any purchases? From where?
- Trial conversion rate?
- Continue what works, stop what doesn't

**Budget**: $200 ads + 40 hours time

**Success**: 10+ purchases in 2 months = ~$50-100 revenue = validated there's SOME demand

**Failure**: < 5 purchases in 2 months = not enough demand = stop wasting time

The market will tell you fast if this is worth continuing.
