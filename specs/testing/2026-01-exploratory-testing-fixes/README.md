## Overview

This specification documents the exploratory testing performed on PDF Finder Pro, identifying security vulnerabilities and code quality issues, along with their fixes.

### Purpose

Perform comprehensive exploratory testing to:
1. Identify security vulnerabilities
2. Find code quality issues
3. Detect UX problems
4. Ensure best practices are followed

### Scope

- Security testing (XSS, injection, path traversal)
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Code quality and maintainability
- UX/accessibility issues

---

## Round 1 - Initial Testing (Completed)

### Issues Found and Fixed

#### Critical Security Issues (4)
1. ✅ **ReDoS Vulnerability** - Regex denial of service in snippet highlighting
2. ✅ **XSS via Inline Handlers** - Cross-site scripting through onclick attributes
3. ✅ **Path Traversal** - Arbitrary file opening without validation
4. ✅ **Directory Traversal** - Symlink escape in indexing

#### Input Validation (4)
5. ✅ **Filter Validation** - Missing validation for size/date filters
6. ✅ **Query Length DoS** - Unbounded query expansion
7. ✅ **Date Format Validation** - Silent failures on invalid dates
8. ✅ **Integer Overflow** - Page count overflow protection

#### UX Improvements (2)
9. ✅ **Auto-trigger Search** - Filters now trigger search automatically
10. ✅ **Better Error Messages** - User-friendly messages without internal details

## Round 2 - Follow-up Testing (In Progress)

### Additional Issues Found

#### Code Quality Issues
1. ✅ **Leftover Global Functions** - `window.__toggleFolderGroup` and `window.__openPdf` still present
2. ✅ **Remaining Inline Handlers** - `onclick` attributes in empty state buttons
3. ✅ **Documentation Organization** - Test docs in root directory instead of specs/

#### Fixes Applied
1. **Removed global window functions** - Replaced comments explaining they're no longer needed
2. **Fixed inline onclick handlers** - Replaced with proper event listeners
3. **Organized documentation** - Moved all test docs to specs/testing/

## Testing Methodology

### Static Code Analysis
- Pattern matching for common vulnerabilities
- Data flow analysis through the application
- Review of all user input points
- Security checklist verification

### Code Review
- Manual review of all source files
- Comparison against OWASP guidelines
- Best practices verification
- Cross-platform considerations

### Tools Used
- `grep` for pattern matching
- Git for code analysis
- Manual code inspection
- Security checklists

---

## Risk Assessment

### Before Round 1
- **Overall Risk**: HIGH
- **Security Risk**: HIGH (4 critical vulnerabilities)
- **Code Quality**: MEDIUM

### After Round 1
- **Overall Risk**: LOW-MEDIUM
- **Security Risk**: LOW (critical issues fixed)
- **Code Quality**: MEDIUM (some cleanup needed)

### After Round 2
- **Overall Risk**: LOW
- **Security Risk**: LOW (all issues resolved)
- **Code Quality**: HIGH (cleanup complete)
