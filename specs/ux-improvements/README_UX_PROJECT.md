## 🛠️ Implementation Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Start Small, Ship Often**

- Test thoroughly before moving on
- Get feedback early and often

**2. Measure Everything**
- Track usage of new features
- Monitor performance metrics
- Survey user satisfaction
- Iterate based on data

**3. Quality Over Quantity**
- Better to do 5 things excellently than 20 things poorly
- Polish matters more than feature count
- Consistency builds trust

**4. Accessibility First**
- Design for all users from the start
- Test with real assistive technology
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines

**5. Performance Budget**
- Every animation must be smooth (60fps)
- No jank or lag
- Use `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
